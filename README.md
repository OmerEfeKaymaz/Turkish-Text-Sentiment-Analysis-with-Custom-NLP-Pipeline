# Turkish Text Sentiment Analysis with Custom NLP Pipeline üáπüá∑üí¨

This project presents a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline tailored specifically for **Turkish-language sentiment analysis**. It enables the classification of text polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and basic **topic extraction** from sources like social media posts, product reviews, and news articles.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

* **Language-Specific Preprocessing**: Custom tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization optimized for Turkish.
* **Emoji & Emoticon Handling**: Converts emojis and emoticons into meaningful textual representations.
* **Text Vectorization**: Supports both `TF-IDF` and `Word2Vec` for feature extraction.
* **Model Training**: Classification using `Support Vector Machines (SVM)` and `Random Forest Classifier`.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
